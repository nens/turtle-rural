TODO
====

- rural_convert_to_sobek.py has test data in its old location:
  https://office.nelen-schuurmans.nl/svn/Products/Turtle/Trunk/TurtleRural/CFConversie,
  this needs to be copied over. This wasn't done yet as the code contains
  hardcoded windows paths and needs too much adjustments to make integration
  easy at the moment. Ticket #2430.
